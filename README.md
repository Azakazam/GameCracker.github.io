Game Cracker, A mobile site which talks about the Nintendo switch and teaches users about the different types of games available.  This is my final year project which involved me creating a mobile app developed using html/css, javascript, ajax, jquery, bootstrap and various APIs.  This is where I gained experience from advanced front end tools and put all my skills to the limit. The end result of this became a progressive web application which can be downloaded and used offline thanks to the serivce workers.  I also learned techniques such as minimization and learned how to use the lighthouse tool on chrome to fully optimize the whole application, making the app fast and accessible without issue.
